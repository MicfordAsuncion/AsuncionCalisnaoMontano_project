#### Description:
we make a hangman based words guessing game named Adivinar Palabras. 
You can play solo or in a team, and team play offers various options 
for the numbers involved. The game begins with a randomly chosen category 
of animals, things or plants, followed by a word from a respective list.
Players get a clue based on the category, and they choose a level of 
difficulty that decides how many lives they have. Once the game is on,
the players guess one letter at a time (and can ask for a hint to specify 
one letter that hasn't been guessed yet). The game keeps track of letters 
guessed and remaining lives, showing the current state of the word. Correct 
guesses add to player scores; incorrect guesses result in lost lives. The game 
is over when someone has all the letters needed or all lives have been lost. 
Final scores are displayed, identifying the winner or a tie.

#### Description:
The “Adivinar Palabras Game” is a word-guessing game developed using Python's tkinter library, providing an engaging, educational experience for players. The game allows users to guess words from categories like animals, things, and plants, offering both solo and multiplayer modes. It begins with a welcoming interface where players can choose to start the game, add words to the categories, or exit. Words are managed through category-specific CSV files, ensuring the game is easily expandable. Players can contribute their own words to the categories through the GUI, making the game highly customizable and interactive. The program ensures a smooth experience by dynamically checking and creating necessary files during initialization, and offering robust error handling for invalid inputs or missing data.

In solo mode, players guess a word from a random category while managing six lives and one hint. For each incorrect guess, a life is lost, and the game ends either when the player runs out of lives or successfully guesses the word. Multiplayer mode adds a competitive twist, allowing two players to take turns guessing the word, each with six lives and two hints. Gameplay is enhanced through dynamic status updates, showing the word's progress, remaining lives, and hints. The user-friendly design includes helpful messages for errors and progress, while the hint system reveals a random letter to aid players strategically. By combining an educational focus with an engaging design, the Adivinar Palabras Game provides a scalable and fun way to enhance vocabulary and logic skills for all ages.

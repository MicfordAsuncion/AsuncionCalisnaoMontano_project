#### Description:
we make a hangman based words guessing game named Adivinar Palabras. 
You can play solo or in a team, and team play offers various options 
for the numbers involved. The game begins with a randomly chosen category 
of animals, things or plants, followed by a word from a respective list.
Players get a clue based on the category, and they choose a level of 
difficulty that decides how many lives they have. Once the game is on,
the players guess one letter at a time (and can ask for a hint to specify 
one letter that hasn't been guessed yet). The game keeps track of letters 
guessed and remaining lives, showing the current state of the word. Correct 
guesses add to player scores; incorrect guesses result in lost lives. The game 
is over when someone has all the letters needed or all lives have been lost. 
Final scores are displayed, identifying the winner or a tie.
